# Dictionarize PHP
Convert your PHP code to (mostly) working gibberish. Replaces class names, variables and function names to random words from a dictionary.

[Example input](test_input.php)

[Example output](test_output.php)


## Usage
```bash
php dictionarize.php input.php
php dictionarize.php input.php > output.php
```

## Configuration
By default it uses a dictionary located at **/usr/share/dict/polish**, but you can change it easily in the code.
